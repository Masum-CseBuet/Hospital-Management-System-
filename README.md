# Hospital-Management-System-
This is a javafx application that we built as our Database project in Level 2 Term 2 in CSE,BUET. This application incorporates the feauture of managing staff's activity along with patients admission booking and billing etc. All of them will have account that let them be notified of their routine. 

Patients can make appointment as per their needs and also they are able to view their previous reports and prescription . This feature removes the hassle of maintaining all records for future appoitment . 
Doctors can also view the previous check-up history of his patient which enables him to diagnose the disease more accurately . 

For database management , we used [Oracle DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database).
